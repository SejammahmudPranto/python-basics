in array module in python, multidimensional array does not work
this is why we use numpy 

ways of creating arrays in numpy:
array()  = all values must be same type
linspance()  = divide any part into a fixed number ex: arr = linspace(1,4, 3) will return 1,2.5,4  #default part is 50
logspace()
arange() = 
  ex:
  val3 = arange(1, 6, 2)
  print(val3)  will return 1,3, 5
zeros()  == all values are zero
ones()  == same as zero but one

copying array:
two types of copy:
  shallow copy = arrays depend with each other
    ex: arr2 = arr1.view()
  deep copy = arrays doesnot depends on each other
    ex:arr2 = arr1.copy()
