break: to get out of look

example:
available = 5 #number of available candies

user_need = int(input("Enter the amount: ")) #prompt user for candy
i=1
while ( i <= user_need) :

        if i > available:
            print("out of stock")
            break #just get out of the loop
        else:
            print(f"{i} candy")
            i += 1


print("Good Bye!")



Continue: just the skip the remaining execution and continue the loop

ex:
for i in range(100):
    if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0:
        continue #continue means just skip the remaining things
    print(i)


print("Good Bye!")

pass: 
Diff b/w Continue and Pass:
  Continue skip the loop , will not executes the below statements and goes to top of loop, where pass executes the remaining logic. Example below.

Continue :

for i in range(11):
      if (i%2==0):
        continue
      print( i , " is odd")
----------------------------------------
1  is odd
3  is odd
5  is odd
7  is odd
9  is odd

Pass : there is no code here in this condiion

for i in range(11):
      if (i%2==0):
        pass
      print( i , " is an number")
---------------------------------------------
0  is an number
1  is an number
2  is an number
3  is an number
4  is an number
5  is an number
6  is an number
7  is an number
8  is an number
9  is an number
10  is an number
